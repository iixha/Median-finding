# Median-finding
This project presents three algorithms with three data structures for each algorithm and compares the speed of these algorithms in finding the median using the Python language. It also reads data from a CSV file and stores it in data structures
Note : The data used in this project are the ages of approximately 100,000 people who have contracted COVID-19
##programming language
Python

# Objective
The main goal of the project is to compare the Sorting algorithms in finding the median.

## IDE to Start the Project:
Spyder IDE
